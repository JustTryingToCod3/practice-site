# projects-and-practice
Project Portfolio

Hello World, I am just here to code. I made this website just to teach myself and have fun with projects. There is so much to learn so this website will just keep getting updated as I go. Perhaps I will make more advaned ones in the future. Some of the projects I have done were in other programming languages like Python or Java, but I decided to translate the logic to JavaScript. 

Hope you enjoy!
