# projects-and-practice
Project Portfolio

Hello World, 👋 I am just here to learn to code. I made this website just to teach myself and just have fun with projects. There is so much to learn so this website is just getting started. Perhaps I will make more advaned ones in the future. We'll see... 🤷‍♀️ Some of the projects I have were in other programming languages (Python, Java) but I decided to translate the logic to JavaScript just to learn another language while I build on those two. 😅

Hope you enjoy! 😊
